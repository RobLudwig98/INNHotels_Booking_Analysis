# INNHotels_Booking_Analysis
A data science project predicting booking cancellations to optimize resource management and improve customer satisfaction for INN Hotels using Python and machine learning techniques.
This repository contains my data analysis project for an advanced data science course, focused on predicting booking cancellations for INN Hotels. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization to uncover insights into booking patterns and cancellation factors.
Key Features

    Predictive Modeling: Develop Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to forecast booking cancellations.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand booking patterns and key factors influencing cancellations.
    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
    Interactive Visualizations: Reveal insights into customer behavior and booking trends.

Skills Showcased

    Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
    Predictive Modeling
    Feature Engineering
    Data Visualization
    Version Control: Git and GitHub

Findings from this project were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation, also available in this repository, demonstrating the application of data analysis to real-world business challenges in the hotel industry.
Project Overview
Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to predict booking cancellations for INN Hotels. By identifying factors that lead to cancellations, the hotel can implement strategies to reduce cancellation rates, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall operational efficiency.
Objectives

    Analyze booking data to understand patterns and key factors influencing cancellations.
    Develop predictive models to accurately forecast cancellations based on historical booking data.
    Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate cancellations and improve hotel operations.

Project Description

This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict hotel booking cancellations. Key activities include:

    Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about booking patterns.
    Preprocessing data to ensure it is clean and ready for modeling.
    Developing and evaluating predictive models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree) to forecast cancellations.
    Providing recommendations based on model insights to reduce cancellations and improve hotel operations.

Metrics Evaluated

    Lead Time: The time between booking and arrival.
    Average Price Per Room: The cost of the booking.
    Market Segment Type: The type of booking (e.g., online, offline).
    Special Requests: The number of special requests made by customers.
    Booking Status: Whether the booking was canceled or not.

Evaluations Conducted

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing booking data to identify patterns and key factors influencing cancellations.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by removing duplicates, treating missing values, handling outliers, and creating new features.
    Model Development: Building and evaluating predictive models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree) to forecast cancellations.
    Model Performance Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
    Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying the most important features influencing booking cancellations.

Key Findings

    Lead Time: Most bookings have short lead times, indicating last-minute decisions.
    Cancellation Policies: Bookings with long lead times are more likely to be canceled, suggesting the need for stricter policies or deposits.
    Dynamic Pricing: Prices between $50-$150 are most common, with higher prices reducing cancellations.
    Marketing Strategies: Different segments exhibit different booking behaviors, indicating the need for tailored promotions.

Recommendations

    Optimize Operations for Last-Minute Bookings: Ensure resources and services are readily available for short lead-time bookings.
    Implement Stricter Cancellation Policies: Require deposits or stricter policies for long lead-time bookings to reduce cancellation risks.
    Adjust Prices Dynamically: Focus on the $50-$150 price range to attract more customers while maximizing revenue.
    Tailor Marketing Strategies: Offer attractive packages for advance bookings and promotions for last-minute bookers.
